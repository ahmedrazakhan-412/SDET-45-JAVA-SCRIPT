//The join() method also joins all array elements into a string.

//It behaves just like toString(), but in addition you can specify the separator:

const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
console.log("Before : "+fruits);
console.log("Result : "+fruits.join(" * "));
console.log("After : "+fruits);
