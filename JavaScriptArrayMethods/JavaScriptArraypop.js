/*Popping and Pushing
When you work with arrays, it is easy to remove elements and add new elements.

This is what popping and pushing is:

Popping items out of an array, or pushing items into an array.

JavaScript Array pop()

The pop() method removes the last element from an array:*/

const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
console.log("Before : "+fruits);
console.log("Result : "+fruits.pop());
console.log("After : "+fruits);
//The pop() method returns the value that was "popped out":
