//  here's an example of how to sort an array in JavaScript using an arrow function:

const myArray = [4, 1, 6, 3, 8, 2];

myArray.sort((a, b) => b - a);

console.log(myArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8]

/* In the example above, we first declare an array called myArray with six integers. 
Then, we use the sort method on that array with an arrow function as the argument. 
The arrow function takes two parameters (a and b) 
which represent the current element being evaluated and the next element respectively.
When sort() calls this function to compare two elements, 
it will return a negative value if a is less than b, 
and positive value if a is greater than b, 
and 0 if they are equal. 
By subtracting b from a, we are effectively comparing a and b numerically, 
and returning a negative value if a is less than b.

This way, when sort() compares two elements in the array using this function, 
it will sort the array in ascending order based on the numeric value of each element.
Inside the arrow function, we subtract b from a. 
This will cause the sort method to compare each element to the next element 
and sort the array in ascending order.

Finally, we log the sorted array to the console using console.log(myArray).*/
