/* Hoisting
Unlike functions, and other JavaScript declarations, class declarations are not hoisted.

That means that you must declare a class before you can use it:

Example
//You cannot use the class yet.
//myCar = new Car("Ford")
//This would raise an error.*/

class Car {
  constructor(brand) {
    this.carname = brand;
  }
}

//Now you can use the class:
let myCar = new Car("Ford");


// Note: For other declarations, like functions, 
// you will NOT get an error when you try to use it before it is declared, 
// because the default behavior of JavaScript declarations are hoisting (moving the declaration to the top).*/


// Example variable hoisting

console.log(a+b);

var a = 50;
var b = 40;
